<p> I am a master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at The University of British Columbia (UBC), working with Prof. Matei Ripeanu. During my grad studies at UBC, I did an 8-month internship at TELUS Communications Inc. and MobileLIVE as a Network Engineer. Before starting my graduate studies in Canada, I worked for a year as a research intern at IST Austria, where I was hosted by Prof. Dan Alistarh. Prior to that, I did an internship at EPFL under the guidance of Dr. Mirjana Stojilovic and Prof. Paolo Ienne. I did my undergraduate studies at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). </p> 

<p> My current research lies in High-performance computing and its application to genome analysis. In particular, I study different approaches to accelerate DNA sequence alignment by employing available and emerging technologies like Processing-in-Memory (PIM). Some other areas of my interest are federated learning, performance analysis, edge computing, reconfigurable computing, and domain-specific languages.</p>
